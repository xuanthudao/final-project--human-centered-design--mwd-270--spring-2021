            Claude Monet (1840 - 1926) was a great French painter that started the Impressionism era. His father
            initially wanted him to take over family business of the grocery store, but Monet wanted to become an
            artist. In 1851, he entered the Le Havre school of arts. Later on, he met Eugene Boudin who taught him
            how to do oil paint. In 1871, Claude Monet moved to Argenteuil, the most beautiful stretch of the Seine.
            Here, he buys a boat and turns it into a personal studio. Living with Monet in Argenteuil was his wife,
            Camille Doncieux and their son, Jean. Camille has been Monet's model since they met in 1865 and has since
            lived together in poverty. Since then until her death, Camille has always been a fuzzy "muse" in Monet's paintings.

            Claude Monetâ€™s paintings pay attention to nature, respect the expression of light and color, and capture the
            freshness of the first impression with absolute fidelity. He often painted about straw, about the church, about lilies,
            the flowers in the fields, about the Waterloo Bridge and in a series of paintings in the gardens. His paintings of gardens and
            lilies are especially popular with the public.
